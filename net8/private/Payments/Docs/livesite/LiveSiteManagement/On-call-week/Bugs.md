# Bugs

- **Bug triage**
    - Current process continues (Ravi, Panji, Jorge working with Mohit/Ashmita for triaging bugs).
    - We are looking for Mohit to work with Vendor team to triage directly and if they need help, they can reach out to on-call or area owners.
- **Bug troubleshooting/resolution**
    - Vendor team tries to troubleshoot/resolve the bugs
        - They rely on TSG (troubleshoot guide) to get the help, if needed.
    - If they cannot resolve, they reach out to area owner
        - Area owner help vendors to troubleshoot/resolve the issue
        - Vendor team creates a task for the area owner to update the TSG with appropriate details.
        - Area owner updates TSG and close the task
