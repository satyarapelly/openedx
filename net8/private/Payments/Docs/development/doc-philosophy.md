# Philosophy and Principles

## Target audience
Developers and PMs contributing code or docs to PX

## Philosophy 
At Payments, we believe that good documentation is critical to business success. It ensures a 
**common understanding** of scenarios, design, tools & processes, and roles & responsibilities. 
This allows us (across functions and teams) to work better, towards common goals and ensure service 
reliability and agility, in a sustained manner. 

## Principles
Below are principles that map philosophies into actions:

1. Docs are written "once" and read many times.
    1. Peer-review docs, like we do code
    2. Focus on readability of docs in peer-reviews
2. Writing docs is like writing tests, they slow us down a bit today but speed us up a lot, tomorrow.
    1. PR approvers are responsible to justify PRs without doc updates
    2. Reduce hurdles to documentation by improving tooling and processes
3. Docs will go stale.  That's inevitable over time.
    1. Instrument page views and focus on keeping the most used pages up-to-date
    2. Make it easy for readers to report issues or ask for help when docs don't suffice
4. Writing good docs is an act of kindness and empathy towards the reader
    1. Helping others is one of the 3 circles of impact that we measure ourselves by
    2. Add mechanisms to "like" a well written document and measure this
    3. Measure our ability and willingness to improve docs on receiving feedback from readers
